INST126 Project 2 Hangman Game

This is a Readme.txt file for Noah Shaw's INST126 Project 2: Hangman Game

This implementation of Hangman done by Noah is very efficient and simple

By using lists and built-in Python methods, this program randomly chooses an encrypted word from a predetermined list of words and puts users through a Hangman game. The users have 10 lives or tries to correctly guess the encrypted word. If they correctly guess the word without running out of lives, they get to see the decrypted message at the end.

User input has been processed so that cases of human error are kept to a minimum.

The decryption function included decrypts the encrypted ciphertext based on the encryption algorithm that was provided to us.

Comments have been provided throughout to help explain and clarify the code segments.
